Network Statistics Sample SDN Application With OpenDaylight

Bundled into a beautiful GUI, Network Statistics SDN Application runs on-top of a OpenDaylight SDN Controller and tracks port & table statistics of devices/nodes managed via OpenDaylight SDN Controller. Pure jQuery/Bootstrap and HTML based application without any server-side code.

Things you can do in this application:

    Supply the URL/Username/Password of your OpenDaylight SDN Controller. Start tracking Nodes!
    View all the nodes managed by OpenDaylight in Network Devices section.
    View Port and Table statistics of each node found.

If you are interested in running it:

    You can get the complete code from my git or if that’s too much work and you don’t intend to change code & just want to see it in action, download the file of this application from here (do “Save Link As“, this is .png, rename it to .war).
    Run the application either from code or by dropping the .war into tomcat/jetty/jboss (some web server)
    Supply your pre-installed OpenDaylight credentials and see it in action at http://localhost:8080/NetworkStatsApplication/
